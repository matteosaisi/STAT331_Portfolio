```{r}
#| label: wd-1-csv

#Lab 2, Question 1
surveys <- read_csv(here::here("data", 
                               "surveys.csv"))

```

-   `xlsx`

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-xlsx

## Reproducibility

**R-1: I can create professional looking, reproducible analyses using RStudio projects, Quarto documents, and the here package.**

I've done this in the following provided assignments: Lab3, Lab 4

**R-2: I can write well documented and tidy code.**

-   Example of **ggplot2** plotting

```{r}
#| label: r-2-1

#Lab 2, Question 16
#| label: rotated-boxplot

ggplot(surveys, aes(x = weight, 
                    y = species)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, 
              color = "blue") +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Weight (grams)", 
       y = "",
       title = "Weight by Species")

```

-   Example of **dplyr** pipeline

```{r}
#| label: r-2-2

#Lab 3, Question 5
teacher_evals_clean <- teacher_evals |>
  mutate(teacher_id = as.factor(teacher_id)) |>
  rename(sex = gender) |>
  filter(no_participants >= 10) |>
  select(course_id, 
         teacher_id,
         question_no,
         no_participants,
         resp_share,
         SET_score_avg,
         percent_failed_cur,
         academic_degree,
         seniority,
         sex) 

```

-   Example of function formatting

```{r}
#| label: r-2-3



```

**R-3: I can write robust programs that are resistant to changes in inputs.**

-   Example -- any context

```{r}
#| label: r-3-example

#Lab 3, Question 10
teacher_evals_clean |>
  filter(question_no == 901) |>
  group_by(teacher_id) |>
  summarise(mean_score = mean(SET_score_avg)) |>
  filter(mean_score == max(mean_score) | mean_score == min(mean_score)) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_score))

```

-   Example of function stops

```{r}
#| label: r-3-function-stops



```

## Data Visualization & Summarization

**DVS-1: I can create visualizations for a *variety* of variable types (e.g., numeric, character, factor, date)**

-   at least two numeric variables

```{r}
#| label: dvs-1-num

#Lab 2, Question 4
ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + 
  geom_point(color = "darkblue", alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  labs(x = "Weight (grams)", 
       y = "",
       subtitle = "Hindfoot Length (millimeters)",
       title = "Hindfoot Length vs. Weight Faceted by Species of Animal")

```

-   at least one numeric variable and one categorical variable

```{r}
#| label: dvs-2-num-cat

#Lab 2, Question 16
ggplot(surveys, aes(x = weight, y = species)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = "blue") +

  labs(x = "Weight (g)", y = "", subtitle = "Species", legend = "Genus")

```

-   dates (timeseries plot)

```{r}
#| label: dvs-2-date



```

```{r}
#| label: dvs-2-1

#Lab 4, Question 7 (Using subtitle instead of y label)
ca_childcare |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mhi_2018, y = mc_infant)) +

       y = "",
       subtitle = "Weekly Center-Based Infant Childcare Cost ($)",
       title = "Weekly Center-Based Infant Childcare Cost vs Median Houshold Income")

```

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2008, 
                                2010, 
                                2012, 
                                2014, 
                                2016, 
                                2018)) +
  facet_wrap(~ (mc_cat = fct_relevel(mc_cat, 
                                     "Infant", 
                                     "Toddler",

  labs(y = "",
       x = "Study Year",
       color = "California Region",
       title = "Weekly Median Price for Center-Based Childcare ($)")

**DVS-4: I can calculate numerical summaries of variables.**

-   Example using `summarize()`

```{r}
#| label: dvs-4-summarize

#Lab 3, Question 10
teacher_evals_clean |>
  filter(seniority == 1) |>
  group_by(teacher_id) |>
  summarise(avg_fail = mean(percent_failed_cur)) |>
  filter(avg_fail == max(avg_fail) | avg_fail == min(avg_fail)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_fail))

#Lab 4, Question 4
ca_childcare |>
  select(region, mhi_2018, study_year) |>
  filter(study_year %in% c(2008, 2018)) |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarize(avg_income = mean(mhi_2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = study_year, values_from = avg_income) |>
  arrange(desc(`2018`))

```

-   Example using `across()`

```{r}
#| label: dvs-4-across

#Lab 3, Question 7 (R recommended I use if_any instead of across)
teacher_evals_clean |>
  filter(
    if_any(.cols = teacher_id:sex,
           .fns = ~ is.na(.x)
           )
    )

```

**DVS-5: I can find summaries of variables across multiple groups.**

-   Example 1

```{r}
#| label: dvs-5-1

#Lab 4, Question 4
ca_childcare |>
  select(region, mhi_2018, study_year) |>
  filter(study_year %in% c(2008, 2018)) |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarize(avg_income = mean(mhi_2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = study_year, values_from = avg_income) |>
  arrange(desc(`2018`))

```

-   Example 2

```{r}
#| label: dvs-5-2

#Lab 4, Question 12
teacher_evals_clean |>
  filter("female" %in% sex, "dr" %in% academic_degree, "ma" %in% academic_degree) |>
  group_by(teacher_id) |>
  summarise(avg_resp = mean(resp_share)) |>
  filter(avg_resp == max(avg_resp) | avg_resp == min(avg_resp)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_resp))

```

**DVS-6: I can create tables which make my summaries clear to the reader.**

-   Example 1

```{r}
#| label: dvs-6-1

#Lab 3, Question 11
teacher_evals_clean |>
  filter(seniority == 1) |>
  group_by(teacher_id) |>
  summarise(avg_fail = mean(percent_failed_cur)) |>
  filter(avg_fail == max(avg_fail) | avg_fail == min(avg_fail)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_fail))

```

-   Example 2

```{r}
#| label: dvs-6-2

#Lab 3, Question 10
teacher_evals_clean |>
  filter(seniority == 1) |>
  group_by(teacher_id) |>
  summarise(avg_fail = mean(percent_failed_cur)) |>
  filter(avg_fail == max(avg_fail) | avg_fail == min(avg_fail)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_fail))

```

**DVS-7: I show creativity in my tables.**

-   Example 1

```{r}
#| label: dvs-7-1

```

-   Example 2

```{r}
#| label: dvs-7-2

```

## Program Efficiency

**PE-1: I can write concise code which does not repeat itself.**

-   using a single function call with multiple inputs (rather than multiple function calls)

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-one-call

#Lab 3, Question 5
teacher_evals_clean <- teacher_evals |>
  mutate(teacher_id = as.factor(teacher_id)) |>
  rename(sex = gender) |>
  filter(no_participants >= 10) |>
  select(course_id, 
         teacher_id,
         question_no,
         no_participants,
         resp_share,
         SET_score_avg,
         percent_failed_cur,
         academic_degree,
         seniority,
         sex) 

```

-   `across()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-across

#Lab 3, Question 7 (R recommended I use if_any instead of across)
teacher_evals_clean |>
  filter(
    if_any(.cols = teacher_id:sex,
           .fns = ~ is.na(.x)
           )
    )

```

-   `map()` functions

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-map-1


```

**PE-2: I can write functions to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   Function that operates on vectors

```{r}
#| label: pe-2-1

```

-   Function that operates on data frames

```{r}
#| label: pe-2-2

```

**PE-3:I can use iteration to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   `across()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-across

```

-   `map()` function with **one** input (e.g., `map()`, `map_chr()`, `map_dbl()`, etc.)

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-map-1

```

-   `map()` function with **more than one** input (e.g., `map_2()` or `pmap()`)

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-map-2

```

**PE-4: I can use modern tools when carrying out my analysis.**

-   I can use functions which are not superseded or deprecated

```{r}
#| label: pe-4-1

#Lab 3, Question 9
teacher_evals_clean |>
  count(course_id, teacher_id) |>
  filter(n == 9)

```

-   I can connect a data wrangling pipeline into a `ggplot()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-4-2

#Lab 4, Question 6

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

<!-- For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g., boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions. -->

Throughout the course I have done my best to revise and resubmit every assignment that I have received a growing on. I did not just do this to receive a better grade, I did it to correct small mistakes and try to learn how I could improve on my assignments. While in some cases, my mistakes may have been repeated, I have always believed that practice makes perfect and it will often take multiple trials to get things close to perfect. This being said, I have always seen revisions as a chance to continue practicing my skills in R and increase my attention to detail when it comes to little things that make big differences.

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I believe that I mainly demonstrated extended thinking within my challenge assignments. During the challenge assignments I always did my best to attempt the most difficult challenge and at least struggle with the problems a little bit to get better at critical thinking and working around issues in R. During my assignments I believe I extended my thinking by doing my best to find a solution that I was confident in (and understood) and not just surrender to the problem / accept that I was going to get a “growing.”

## Peer Support & Collaboration

<!-- Include an image or a description of feedback you gave that you are proud of (either in a peer review or in Discord). -->

This was a peer review that I was proud of:
"Hey Khoa, great job on Lab 4!

First off, I noticed that your code is very tidy for the most part. There were a couple instances where you could have made some returns after commas, but for the most part you did very well. Additionally, I appreciate you sizing down the text size on the x-axis of your graph, I will definitely be adding that to my revisions!

One thing that you might be able to do better is in question 3, instead of using case_when(), you could use fct_collapse() in order to collapse the counties into region groups. This way you don't have to repetitively type "county_name %in%". Furthermore, this change would save you some time in writing your code for question 6 (the graph), as your region factors will already be in place.

Again, great job on lab 4!"

<!-- Include a description of how you grew as a collaborator through the weekly pair programming activities.   -->

I think when it came to working in a pair on practice activities, I never really had any large issues. I was always trying to be conscious of the coder and developer roles and follow the directions as best as possible. I think where I improved was in my advice as the developer to the coder. I became better at explaining my thought processes and explaining how I knew something made sense a certain way. This allowed me and my partner to be much more efficient with our practice activities and gave us more time to learn what was going on in the R code.

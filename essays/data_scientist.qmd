***Describe how you have improved as a practitioner and student of data science this quarter through your work in the course.***

-   Focus specifically on data science concepts and the skills we employed in learning them, not a laundry list of topics that you learned (those are in the syllabus, so I know them already).

-   Focus on a small number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STAT 331. Identify at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth and explain how this artifact shows growth in the way you are describing.

Through my work in this course, I have significantly enhanced my skills and abilities in data science, and more specifically in R. I have developed a solid understanding of essential skills such as manipulating data sets with dplyr pipelines and creating well labeled and organized graphs with ggplot. These are skills that I have already found myself applying in my other classes and I can see myself continuing to use these skills throughout my career. In learning and applying these skills, I also found myself extending my thinking (or critical thinking) through the creation of diagrams or searching for better ways to approach a problem. With this being said, I think I most improved in my ability to critical think my way to a solution using the tools I have learned. One artifact of my portfolio that I believe demonstrated this area of growth is the code I used for PE-4-2 (and a few other targets). In this code, I utilized a dplyr pipeline to select specific columns that were necessary for the problem, I then pivoted the columns longer and recoded the factors using a mutate function. After I had done this, I piped the prepared data frame into a ggplot and proceeded to reorder the factors, create facets, add labels, and resize the x-axis text to make it more readable. This problem challenged me in that I had to find a way to apply newly learned "forcats" package functions to my factors while using my solid understanding of dplyr pipelines and ggplot.
